# Demo Fencing Webpage
A 3rd year web design project with the theme of Fencing. 


UCD Fencing has been lacking in terms of providing public information through the use of a web page. 
As a result, my idea was to design a web page with a fresh new look that the club can utilize. The design provides a generic approach in which the club can later adapt by adding their own favorite photos, and flavored texts. 

To preview the webpage hosted on Google App Engine:

# Home Page
The home page utilizes a slider to provide the most important and current information about the club. Currently, it iterates through 3 different slides.

# News Cards

The functionality of the news cards is to provide the first few lines into the news article that the club members would write about the fencing club. Each news cards will have a unique tag e.g. Sports, to indicate the type of news the article will provide. 

# Membership
![Membership](https://github.com/k3vonk/Fencing-Demo-Webpage/blob/main/website_images/Form.png)
The UCD Fencing club charges a set cost to members each year to be apart of the club. To enhance the process, I have provided a form that users can initiate the membership sign ups. 

# Contact 
![Contact](https://github.com/k3vonk/Fencing-Demo-Webpage/blob/main/website_images/contact_with_interactive_social_media_links.png)
The general purpose of this section is to provide club contact information. Additionally, each page contains the same footer where users can find the fencing club's social media accounts.
