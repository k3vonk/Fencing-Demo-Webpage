# Demo Fencing Webpage
A 3rd year web design project with the theme of Fencing. 


UCD Fencing has been lacking in terms of providing public information through the use of a web page. 
As a result, my idea was to design a web page with a fresh new look that the club can utilize. 
I tried to generic visuals in which the club can later adapt by adding their own favorite photos, and flavored texts. 

To preview the webpage, I have hosted the application on Google App Engine:
